                <p>Transitioning from the restaurant industry to full-stack
            development, I've decided to explore a new path that allows me to
            integrate my passion for design and art with the endless world of
            technology. Using the skills I've accumulated in my full-stack
            coding certification to continue creating beautiful and
            productive websites. My experiences have allowed me to develop essential skills such as
            teamwork, adaptability, and customer service. These attributes are
            now driving my transition into the world of technology, coding, and
            creative problem-solving. I'm hoping to integrate my passion for design and art with the
            endless world of technology.</p>
